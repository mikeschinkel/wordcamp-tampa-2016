#Unzipping vagrant.d.zip

The file `vagrant.d.zip` is included on the four (4) thumb drives we have to pass around in case downloading is too slow. `vagrant.d.zip` contains the **VirtualBox VM Image** of WPLib Box.

##If you have EXISTING Vagrant Boxes

- Please ask for help.


##If you have NEVER installed Vagrant Before

1. Change directory to your home/user profile directory:

- On Mac OS X

		cd ~/
	

- On Windows Powershell

		Set-Location -Path c:$env:userprofile
	

- On Windows _(No Powershell)_

		c:
		cd %UserProfile%
	
2. Using Finder or Windows Explorer copy the file from the thumb drive into your home/user profile directory.

3. Unzip the file in your home/user profile directory.

4. Verify that you have a directory named `.vagrant.d` in your home/user profile directory &mdash; _(note the leading period '`.`')_

5. If the directory exists you are all done!  

6. If not, as for help.
